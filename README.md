# Arduino-Alarm-Clock

This project was made to experiment with the ESP32's ability to connect to wifi and retrieve time. The alarm clock (shown below) has an OLED displace to show the time, date, and current alarm set. Since there is no storage module in this project, the alarm is defaulted to NONE when the device is unplugged and replugged. 

Here are a few photos of the alarm clock.
